# 🌐 CSS Layouts Projects

This repository contains **three projects** built as part of the  
🎓 **[CSS Layouts](https://almdrasa.com/tracks/frontend/courses/css-layouts/)** course offered by [Almdrasa](https://almdrasa.com).

In this course, I learned modern CSS layout techniques, including **floats, Flexbox, and Grid**, and explored positioning strategies (relative, absolute, fixed) to build responsive, flexible page layouts.
